# Machine Learning | COVID-19

Our goal is to collaborate in managing the separation, recycling and incineration of household and hospital waste. In this project, we will address the importance of using artificial intelligence and methods for applying classification models for moments of crisis, such as this one by COVID-19. Through a synthetic dataset, we will use machine learning models to classify contaminated and non-contaminated objects and, thus, assist in correct disposal solutions for these residues.
